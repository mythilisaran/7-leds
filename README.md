To implement and test the Arduino program you provided with hardware, follow these step-by-step instructions:

Hardware Setup
Gather Your Components:

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
7 LEDs
7 resistors (220 ohms or 330 ohms)
Breadboard
Jumper wires
Connect the LEDs:

LEDs:
Insert the LEDs into the breadboard. Make sure each LED's longer leg (anode) is in a different row from the shorter leg (cathode).
Resistors:
Connect one end of each resistor to the anode (longer leg) of each LED.
Connect the other end of each resistor to the corresponding Arduino pin as described below.

Wiring the LEDs:

LED on Pin 13:
Connect the anode of the LED to pin 13 on the Arduino through a resistor.
Connect the cathode of the LED to the ground rail on the breadboard.
LED on Pin 12:
Connect the anode of the LED to pin 12 on the Arduino through a resistor.
Connect the cathode of the LED to the ground rail on the breadboard.
LED on Pin 11:
Connect the anode of the LED to pin 11 on the Arduino through a resistor.
Connect the cathode of the LED to the ground rail on the breadboard.
LED on Pin 10:
Connect the anode of the LED to pin 10 on the Arduino through a resistor.
Connect the cathode of the LED to the ground rail on the breadboard.
LED on Pin 9:
Connect the anode of the LED to pin 9 on the Arduino through a resistor.
Connect the cathode of the LED to the ground rail on the breadboard.
LED on Pin 8:
Connect the anode of the LED to pin 8 on the Arduino through a resistor.
Connect the cathode of the LED to the ground rail on the breadboard.
LED on Pin 7:
Connect the anode of the LED to pin 7 on the Arduino through a resistor.
Connect the cathode of the LED to the ground rail on the breadboard.
Power and Ground Connections:

Connect the ground (GND) pin on the Arduino to the ground rail on the breadboard.
Ensure all the ground rails on the breadboard are interconnected.
Programming and Execution
Connect the Arduino to Your Computer:

Use a USB cable to connect the Arduino to your computer.
Open the Arduino IDE:

Launch the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) on your computer.
Enter the Code:

Copy and paste the following code into the Arduino IDE:
cpp
Copy code
void setup() {
  // Set all used pins as OUTPUT
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(12, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(11, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(10, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(8, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(7, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Blink LEDs on pins 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, and 7 in sequence
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  delay(100);
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  delay(100);

  digitalWrite(12, HIGH);
  delay(100);
  digitalWrite(12, LOW);
  delay(100);

  digitalWrite(11, HIGH);
  delay(100);
  digitalWrite(11, LOW);
  delay(100);

  digitalWrite(10, HIGH);
  delay(100);
  digitalWrite(10, LOW);
  delay(100);

  digitalWrite(9, HIGH);
  delay(100);
  digitalWrite(9, LOW);
  delay(100);

  digitalWrite(8, HIGH);
  delay(100);
  digitalWrite(8, LOW);
  delay(100);

  digitalWrite(7, HIGH);
  delay(100);
  digitalWrite(7, LOW);
  delay(100);
}
Upload the Code:

Click on the Upload button (right arrow) in the Arduino IDE. This will compile the code and upload it to your Arduino board.
Observe the LEDs:

After the upload is complete, the LEDs connected to pins 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, and 7 should blink on and off in sequence, with each LED being on for 100 milliseconds and off for 100 milliseconds.
Troubleshooting
LEDs Not Lighting Up:

Check the wiring to ensure all connections are secure.
Verify that the resistors are properly connected to prevent excessive current through the LEDs.
LEDs Blinking in Unexpected Sequence:

Double-check the pin numbers in the code match the actual pin connections on the Arduino.
By following these steps, you should be able to successfully set up and test the Arduino program with your LEDs.
